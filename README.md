# Wormy

**Wormy** is a Snake clone built on [Elm](https://elm-lang.com).

Play it online at [itch.io](https://aggressivepixels.itch.io/wormy).

## Building

Assuming you have Elm 0.19 installed, just clone the repository, `cd` into it and then run `elm make src/Main.elm`. This will create an `index.html` file that you can run in your browser.

## Disclaimer

This was a small project to learn functional programming. It's **NOT** good code. It's quite brittle, in fact, and underuses Elm's type system quite a bit. If you're new to functional programming, like me, and you're looking for inspiration or guidance, you should look elsewhere.
